# CMPG-323-Overview - 33526966

## Repository and Project Context diagram
There is a total of five (5) projects to be done throughout the semester:
* Project 1 will make use of <a href="https://github.com/JaneKuali/CMPG-323-Overview---33526966">this</a> repository.
* Project 2 - <a href="https://github.com/JaneKuali/CMPG-323-Project-2---33526966">click here</a>.
* Project 3 can be found <a href="https://github.com/JaneKuali/CMPG323-Project-3---33526966">here</a>.
* Project 4 - <a href="https://github.com/JaneKuali/CMPG-323-Project-4-33526966">click here</a> 
* Project 5 - <a href="https://github.com/JaneKuali/CMPG-323-Project-5---333526966">click here</a> 
These repositories will then be integrated to the main <a href="https://github.com/users/JaneKuali/projects/6">Kanban Project<a/> within <a href="https://github.com/JaneKuali/CMPG-323-Overview---33526966">this</a> repo as shown in the diagram below:

The link to the different repos will be updated in this ReadME.md file when created.

## GitHub Flow Branching Strategy
The branching strategy that will be used within each of the projects is the GitHub Flow as shown below: Image from (GeeksforGeeks, 2022)
![GitHubFlow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81962930/185393200-7cf2594a-3d30-4b0c-8f25-aae0b0f42e1e.jpg)

This is how this branching strategy works:
* Firstly, we need to create a new branch whic will be used to develop the code.
* Having created a new branch (e.g Develop-JaneKuali), we will then have to make use of the branch to make all the changes needed (such as adding, deleting and edititng files). These changes will have to be committed thereafter so it is easier to track the changes made for future edits etc.
* Then, we need to open a Pull Request, adding milestones to it just to demostrate the progress of your project. This is helpful for when reviewing and testing the changes and then finally merging these changes to the main branch.

## The .gitignore file
* Because there are no files present that need to be ignored by GitHub for this repositories - there will therefore be no .gitinore file present.

## Storage of Credentials and Sensitive Information
* Making use of the "Secrets" functionality within GitHub can be used to store sensitive information.
