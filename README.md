# CMPG-323-Overview - 33526966
There is a total of five (5) projects to be done throughout the semester. Each project will use a repository of its own as shown below:
* Project 1 - https://github.com/JaneKuali/CMPG-323-Overview---33526966

## GitHub Flow Branching Strategy
The branching strategy that will be used within each of the projects is the GitHub Flow as shown below: Image from (GeeksforGeeks, 2022)

This is how this branching strategy works:
* Firstly, we need to create a new branch whic will be used to develop the code.
* Having created a new branch (e.g Develop-JaneKuali), we will then have to make use of the branch to make all the changes needed (such as adding, deleting and edititng files). These changes will have to be committed thereafter so it is easier to track the changes made for future edits etc.
* Then, we need to open a Pull Request, adding milestones to it just to demostrate the progress of your project. This is helpful for when reviewing and testing the changes and then finally merging these changes to the main branch.
